# Backend Developer Test Task.

## Introduction
With this test we want to get an idea of your proficiency in backend related web development
technologies. We will give you a task specification below and you are free to use whatever PHP
libraries, frameworks etc. you consider as useful to implement it together with SQL database
(preferably MySQL or SQLite).
You shall provide us with a hosted git repository of your resulting work including a readme file to
describe the required steps to deploy it locally.

## Task
Implement a REST API that shall be used internally, so no authentication is needed. Format shall be JSON. No frontÂ­end or graphical interface is needed.

## Installation
- Clone repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tonimitrevski/Bank-Transaction.git
```
- Run in your terminal
```
$ composer install
$ php artisan key:generate

## Setup
```
- Setup database connection in .env file ( Change .env.example file to .env)
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

- Install node package manager NPM
```
$ npm install
```
- Migrate tables with demo data
```
$ php artisan migrate --seed
```

- Laravel 5 Files Folders Permission and Ownership Setup
```
$ cd /dir/of/laravel
$ chmod -R 777 ./storage ./bootstrap

You may need to use sudo on these commands if you get permission denied errors, i.e.:
$ sudo cd /path/to/banktransaction
$ sudo chmod -R 777 ./storage ./bootstrap

- Access it on

## Known Issues
- Something that you can find in every piece of code(#the_master_is_not_born_yet)

## Task version v1.0
- Database migration schema (users table, countries table, transactions table etc.)
- Creating models (User(Customer), Transaction etc.)
- Implementing Query Object (we could extract to the model - query scope, create a repository, or we could make a single-use query class as OptimisticLockingTransaction) to perform our complex query operations that can be changed offten
- Making WeeklyReport service (implementing some ReportService interface) for the business logic or business layer of the application
- Implementing Pessimistic vs Optimistic Locking ( https://medium.com/snapptech/pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking-in-laravel-264ec0b1ba2 )
- Tests (Feature test - UpdateUserInSameTimeTest, Unit test - MakeTransactionTest)
- Database seeders (UsersSeeder, CountrySeeder, TransactionsSeeder)
